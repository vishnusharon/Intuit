## Setup

Please complete this R-markdown document with your group by answering the questions in `intuit-trees.pdf` on Dropbox (week7/readings/). Create an HTML file with all your results and comments and push both the Rmarkdown and HTML file to GitLab when your team is done. All results MUST be reproducible (i.e., the TA and I must be able to recreate the HTML from the Rmarkdown file without changes or errors).

This is the second group assignment for MGTA 455 and you will be using git and GitLab. If two people edit the same file at the same time you could get what is called a "merge conflict". git will not decide for you who's change to accept so the team-lead will have to determine which edits to use. To avoid merge conflicts, always click "pull" in Rstudio before you start working on file. Then, when you are done, commit your changes, and push them to GitLab. Make this a habit!

If multiple people are going to work on the assignment at the same time I recommend you work on different files. You can use `source` to include R-code in your Rmarkdown document or include other R(markdown) documents into the main assignment file. 

Group work-flow tips are listed from ICT in summer are shown below:

* Pull, edit, save, stage, commit, and push
* Schedule who does what and when
* Try to avoid working simultaneously on the same file 
* If you are going to work simultaneously, do it in different files, e.g., 
    - assignment1_john.R, assignment1_susan.R, assignment1_wei.R 
    - assignment1a.R, assignment1b.R, assignment1c.R
* Use the 'source' command to bring different pieces of code together in an Rmarkdown document or in an R-code file
* Alternatively, use _child_ in Rmarkdown to include a part of a report
* For (very) big projects use 'branches' to avoid conflicts (and stay on your branch)

A graphical depiction of the group work-flow is shown below:

```{r}
## loading the data. Note that data must be loaded from the data/
## in the rstudio project directory
intuit75k_wrk <- readr::read_rds("data/intuit75k.rds")

## Recall that Radiant stores all datasets in a list called r_data 
## if you are planning to use data transformation commands generated by Radiant  
## uncomment the lines below and comment out the line above
# if (!exists("r_data")) r_data <- list()
# r_data[["intuit75k_wrk"]] <- readr::read_rds("data/intuit75k.rds")
```

Below an example of how you could include another Rmd file inside your main assignment Rmarkdown document. Note:  don't add a YAML header to the _child_ file! 

```{r, child = "question-1.Rmd"}
```

Alternatively you can source code from an .R file as follows:

```{r}
source("question-1.R", local = TRUE)
```
